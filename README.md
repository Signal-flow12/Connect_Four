# Connect4!

## Overview
 The game is connect connect4! Connect4 has two players, a red player and a yellow player. Each player will place their colored disc into the 7x6 grid, taking turns. Players will drop their discs into the grid stacking them upwards, horizontally, or diagonally. You cannot place a disc anywhere within the grid. The disc must start on the bottom and will then stack upon another disk. The disk cannot float within the grid, "gravity" will push it down. The first player to have four of their disk in a row, horizontally or diagnollay, will win the game! 

## How to play
1. To start the game player 1 must choose their color. 
2. Click wihin the grid to place your disk. (*Reminder dont forget about gravity!*)
3. It is now player 2 turn. Player  2 will click within the grid to place their disk. (*Reminder you can stack your disk ontop of others*)
4. Continue taking tearns until a player connects4!
5. Once a player wins their win tally will increase and the board must be cleared to start a new game.
6. If there is no winner and the board is full, click the clear button. (**!Warrning! clearing the board resets the game and no player gets a win.**)
